(*deployed with herokuapp*)

## TEST--
(*imp*)The web app is a single user app.Therefore everything added and deleted is shared on the screen.Since there is no single user login(*currently trying to implement it*),it is highly advised not to spam the todo list.Be mindful of what you add since i have the access to the database.
